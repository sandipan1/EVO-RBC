Ant observations/todos after 3rd repo
1. some legs still don't move in a few gaits, maybe increase control freq range but then can't stay still.... (maybe penalise this.. difference in leg speed)
2. the topmost speed isn't fast enough could increase the range
3. evolved behaviors are good.
4. since things have saturated and mutation isn't leading anywhere great, should start including crossover

## Control function for joints used for hexapod
In the ant implementation, frequency is also taken as variable parameter since it helps in varying velocity
